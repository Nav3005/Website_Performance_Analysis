### Project Overview
Time Series Analysis is essential for forecasting, especially in domains like finance, retail, weather, and energy. In this project, ARIMA and SARIMA models are used to forecast and analyze time series data, capturing patterns and seasonal trends effectively.

### Features
- Data preprocessing for time series analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ARIMA model implementation
- SARIMA model implementation for seasonal data
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

### Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries and dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- pmdarima

You can install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels pmdarima
```

### Usage
1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Nav3005/Website_Performance_Analysis>
    cd <TSA_ARIMA_SARIMA.ipynb>
    ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open `TSA_ARIMA_SARIMA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to view and run each section step-by-step.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   Load your time series dataset. Ensure it is in a date-indexed format for the models to perform accurate forecasting.

4. **Model Building**:
   Follow the notebook to build and evaluate the ARIMA and SARIMA models. Hyperparameters can be adjusted in the notebook to tune model performance.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
   - Handle missing values and resample data as necessary to align with the desired time frequency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Perform EDA to identify trends, seasonality, and potential patterns in the data.
   - Visualize the time series data to gain insights that guide model selection.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - **ARIMA**: Choose ARIMA for non-seasonal time series data or when periodic patterns are not significant.
   - **SARIMA**: Apply SARIMA when seasonality is present, adding seasonal components to better capture cyclic trends.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and residual plots to evaluate the model.
   - Adjust model parameters based on evaluation results to enhance forecasting accuracy.

### Comparison Between ARIMA and SARIMA

#### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Usage**: ARIMA is effective for time series data without strong seasonal patterns. It models the relationship between past values and forecast values through autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components, alongside differencing to make the data stationary.
- **Strengths**: ARIMA is straightforward and well-suited for data that lacks seasonal variation. It captures trends and patterns in non-seasonal time series data.
- **Limitations**: Struggles with data that has clear seasonal or periodic fluctuations, as it does not account for seasonality directly.

#### SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Usage**: SARIMA extends ARIMA by adding seasonal components, allowing it to handle data with periodic patterns and seasonality. It adds seasonal autoregressive, differencing, and moving average terms to the model.
- **Strengths**: SARIMA is highly effective for time series data with seasonality, as it captures both short-term and seasonal dependencies in the data.
- **Limitations**: SARIMA has more parameters than ARIMA, making it more complex to tune and sometimes prone to overfitting if the seasonal component is not carefully specified.

#### Model Performance
In this project:
- **Evaluation Metrics**: We compared ARIMA and SARIMA using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and visualized residuals to assess model fit.
- **Results**: SARIMA generally performed better for datasets with a clear seasonal component due to its ability to model seasonal variations explicitly. ARIMA was more effective when the data showed no apparent seasonality.

### Conclusion
For non-seasonal data, ARIMA offers a simpler and faster approach with satisfactory results. However, when seasonality is present, SARIMA provides more accurate forecasts by modeling these recurring patterns. Thus, **SARIMA was the preferred model in this analysis** for seasonal data.
